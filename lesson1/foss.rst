Free and open-source software (FOSS) is computer software that can be
classified as both **free software** and **open-source
software**. That is, anyone is freely licensed to

* use,
* copy,
* study, and
* change

the software in any way, and the source code is openly shared so that
people are encouraged to voluntarily improve the design of the
software. This is in contrast to **proprietary software**, where the
software is under restrictive copyright and the source code is usually
hidden from the users.
